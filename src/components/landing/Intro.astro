        ACIDS is a collective working across music, technology, and artistic R&amp;D.
        We create releases, performances, tools, and research-driven prototypes -
        bridging sound, code, and visual languages.

        The ACIDS team (formerly at IRCAM) aims to model musical creativity by extending
        probabilistic learning approaches to create the next generation of musical
        instruments. Our main object of study lies in the properties and perception of
        musical synthesis and artificial creativity.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-4">
        In this context, we experiment with deep AI models applied to creative materials,
        aiming to develop artificial creative intelligence. Over the past years, we
        developed several objects embedding these researches directly as real-time
        objects usable in MaxMSP.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-4">
        Our team has produced many prototypes of innovative instruments and musical
        pieces in collaborations with composers and artists such as Bjork, Molecule,
        Canblaster, and Alexander Schubert.
